# Game Rules

## Overview

The game is a turn-based strategy played on a directed graph.
Players compete to control vertices and eliminate opponents through movement and combat.

## Game Setup

### Graph Structure

* The game takes place on a directed graph of vertices connected by edges.
* Each vertex has a **weight** (unit generation rate), a **position** (for visualization only), a **controller** (the owning player or neutral), and a **unit count** (units stationed there).
* Edges are one-way; units may only move in the specified direction.

### Starting Conditions

* A game requires at least two players.
* Each player begins on a random vertex with one unit.
* All other vertices start neutral and uncontrolled.

## Turn Structure

Each turn proceeds in three phases:

1. **Movement & Combat**

   * Players submit movement orders simultaneously.
   * All valid movements are executed.
   * Combat occurs where multiple forces contest a vertex.

2. **Unit Generation**

   * Each controlled vertex produces new units equal to its weight.
   * Units are placed directly on the generating vertex.

3. **Elimination Check**

   * A player with no controlled vertices or no units is eliminated.

Turns repeat until one player remains or the round limit is reached.

## Movement Rules

* Units may only move along directed edges to adjacent vertices.
* Players may only move units from vertices they control.
* A player may not move more units than are present at a vertex.
* Any number of moves may be issued in the same turn.

## Combat Rules

Combat occurs whenever units arrive at a neutral or enemy-controlled vertex.

### Attacking Neutral Vertices

* The attacking force must first pay a cost equal to the vertex weight.
* If the attack force is smaller than the weight, the attack fails.
* If equal or greater, the surplus becomes the effective attacking units.
* A single attacker claims the vertex with the effective units.
* If multiple attackers are present, a winner is chosen randomly with probability weighted by their share of the attacking force.
  The winner controls the vertex with all effective units.

### Attacking Controlled Vertices

If forces move in opposite directions along the same edge, they destroy each other unit-for-unit.
Only the net remainder continues to its destination.

* Combat is resolved by comparing attacking and defending totals (this includes defending units sent from allied vertices!):

  * If attackers have fewer units, the defender wins with the surplus.
  * If both sides are equal, the vertex becomes neutral with no units.
  * If attackers have more units, they win with the surplus.
  * With multiple attackers, a winner is chosen randomly, weighted by contribution.

### Probabilistic Resolution

When multiple attackers contest the same vertex (either neutral or controlled), each playerâ€™s chance of victory is proportional to their contribution.
The chosen winner takes control with all surviving units.

## Victory Conditions

The game ends under the following conditions:

* **Elimination Victory**: Only one player remains in control; that player wins.
* **Turn Limit**: The game reaches its maximum number of turns (default 100). Players are then ranked by survival status, remaining unit count, and elimination order.

## Ranking

* Active players at the end of a timed-out game are ranked by unit count. Equal totals result in ties.
* Eliminated players are ranked in reverse order of elimination. Players eliminated in the same round tie.
